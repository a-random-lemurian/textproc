# textproc - C text processing library

Work in progress. Not meant for production use. textproc does not perform
natural language processing, only string manipulation such as changing the
case of strings (from uppercase to lowercase, etc.), or reversing strings.

See `include/textproc.h` for information on the library, the comments are
there.
